# # collect a string from the user and use loops to count the number of vowels and consonants in the string. 
# # Print the counts. Example:
# # Input: "hello world"
# # Output: Vowels: 3, Consonants: 7

# #         print(l- )



# #  Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and prints the multiplication table for that number up to 12. Example:
# # Input: 5
# # Output:
# # 5 x 1 = 5
# # 5 x 2 = 10
# # 5 x 3 = 15

# # number = int(input('enter a digit:'))

# # for i in range(1, 13):

# # Collect a string from the user and use a loop to reverse the string. Print the reversed string. Do not reverse the string using [::-1] or reversed().
# # Example:
# # Input: "python"
# # Output: "nohtyp"

# # line = input('enter a word:')
# # for  i in range(len(line)-1 , 0, -1):
    
# #     print(line)


# # Write a program that takes a list of numbers (entered as comma-separated values) from the user and removes any duplicate values. Print the new list. Do not use the set() constructor. Use a loop. Example:
# # Input: "1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3"
# # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# integers = list(input('enter numbers: '))

# for i in range(1):
#    set(integers)
#    print(integers)


# Collect a list of numbers from the user (entered as comma-separated values) and use a 
# 	loop to find and print the largest number in the list. Don’t use the built-in max 
# 	function or anything similar.
# 	Input: "10, 20, 5, 15"
# 	Output: 20





# Write a program that takes an integer n from the user and calculates the sum of all 
# 	even numbers from 1 to n. Print the sum.
# 	Input: 10
# 	Output: 30 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)


# Write a program that takes an integer n from the user and calculates the sum of 
# 	squares of all numbers from 1 to n. Print the sum. Example:
# 	Input: 3
# 	Output: 14 (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)



#  11. 	Collect a phrase from the user and use a loop to generate an acronym by taking the first
# 	letter of each word. Print the acronym. Example:
# 	Input: "Portable Network Graphics"



# 	Output: "PNG"
#  12. 	Collect a string from the user and use a loop to count the number of words in the string. 
# 	Print the count. Example:
# 	Input: "Hello world from Python"




# 	Output: 4
#  13. 	Collect a string from the user and only print put the words that start with the letter 
# 	‘S’. Example:
# 	Input: “Print only the words that start with s in this sentence”
# 	Output: 
# 	start
# 	s
# 	Sentence
	




#  14. 	Print all the even numbers from 1 to 20 using the range function and a loop.
